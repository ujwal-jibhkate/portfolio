    "description": "Developed an end-to-end deep learning system that generates radiology reports from chest X-rays. To ensure clinical trust, I engineered a novel dual-audit framework that validates reports for logical consistency and fairness across rare diseases, mitigating the risk of 'plausible nonsense' common in generative models. The system achieves 0.94 ROC-AUC for clinical predictions and 100% logical consistency, demonstrating a reliable foundation for augmenting clinical workflows.",

    "description": "Engineered a multimodal recommendation system that solves the critical 'cold-start' problem by creating dynamic user taste profiles from both visual and textual data. Implemented a production-oriented two-stage (retrieval-then-rank) pipeline using FAISS, reducing the ranking model's computational load by 95%. The system is designed to increase long-term user retention by balancing relevance with content diversity, improving content discovery.",

    "description": "Conducted a deep-dive research project comparing LoRA and IA³ to determine the optimal PEFT method for different tasks. Proved IA³ is more efficient for simple classification, while LoRA is superior for learning complex generative skills. Overcame significant 'NaN loss' numerical instability on a T4 GPU by diagnosing the issue in Gemma-2b and engineering a stable, 8-bit mixed-precision training stack with Pythia-2.8b to successfully benchmark all three transformer architectures (Encoder, Decoder, Encoder-Decoder).",

My contributions included initial research and final report synthesis. We proved that transformer models, when combined with heatmap-based supervision instead of direct coordinate regression, achieve over 93% PCK@0.2 accuracy. This work provides a foundation for developing scalable, non-invasive tools to track animal behavior for conservation and ethology research.",
