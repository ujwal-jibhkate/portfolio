    "description": "Developed an end-to-end deep learning system that generates radiology reports from chest X-rays. To ensure clinical trust, I engineered a novel dual-audit framework that validates reports for logical consistency and fairness across rare diseases, mitigating the risk of 'plausible nonsense' common in generative models. The system achieves 0.94 ROC-AUC for clinical predictions and 100% logical consistency, demonstrating a reliable foundation for augmenting clinical workflows.",

    "description": "Engineered a multimodal recommendation system that solves the critical 'cold-start' problem by creating dynamic user taste profiles from both visual and textual data. Implemented a production-oriented two-stage (retrieval-then-rank) pipeline using FAISS, reducing the ranking model's computational load by 95%. The system is designed to increase long-term user retention by balancing relevance with content diversity, improving content discovery.",

    "description": "Developed a full-stack AI decision assistant that automates the prioritization of innovation ideas, mitigating the financial risk of misallocating R&D resources. Engineered a ReAct-style LLM agent that uses company-specific data (RAG) to provide data-grounded, explainable recommendations. The tool's robust analytical engine and intuitive React UI earned 2nd Place at the Luddy Hackathon, demonstrating a proven ability to deliver user-centric and technically sophisticated AI solutions.",

    "description": "Co-authored a research report benchmarking CNNs against Vision Transformers for the challenging task of multi-ape pose estimation. My contributions included initial research and final report synthesis. We proved that transformer models, when combined with heatmap-based supervision instead of direct coordinate regression, achieve over 93% PCK@0.2 accuracy. This work provides a foundation for developing scalable, non-invasive tools to track animal behavior for conservation and ethology research.",
